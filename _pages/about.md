My name is Danial Alizadeh, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I also hold an M.A. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability at UC Santa Barbara.

My research focuses on understanding and modeling human movement responses to disruptive events such as wildfires, hurricanes, and floods. To achieve this, I use statistical methods alongside machine learning and deep learning models to quantify and analyze how people respond to such disruptions.
